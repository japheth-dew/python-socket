Python has undoubtedly been made known to be one of the most simple languages to learn, this prooved itself again to me with this particular program 
imagine implementing threads with only a line of code... norm i did thred first with java. but TBH... i didn treally wrap my head around it the first time
even till now... but python changes all that, just

``` import threading \\ the required import 
    const thread1 = threading.Thread(yourFunc, args=()) ==> \\ the arg are must to be in tuples and also you cant use parenthenses (!hmmm why dont we just agree its brackets😁), You are passing a reffrence to the function not calling it 
    thread1.start() \\ thats all 
                                ```
Pretty simple right and 😁yes, am exicted, it's my python commit in a long time if there's even any, well i'll check laer, the point is...
